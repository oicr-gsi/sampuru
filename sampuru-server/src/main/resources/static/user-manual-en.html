<h1>Sampuru User Manual</h1>
<p><i>Sampuru</i> is a system for monitoring the quality control ('QC') status of items in the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research ('OICR') labs. You will only be able to see information about samples you provide to OICR, and extractions made from said samples. <i>Sampuru</i> allows you to view information about your <i>projects</i> at varying degrees of granularity and allows you to map the names of your samples to OICR's internal IDs in order to ease communication with OICR.</p>

<h2 id="terminology">Terminology</a></h2>
<p id="terminology-case"><u><i>Case</i></u>: The collection of: an individual sample received by OICR, and every <i>QCable</i> which is extracted from that sample. A <i>case</i> is considered <i>completed</i> when all of the <i>QCables</i> associated with the <i>case</i> have their <i>QC Status</i> set to <i>Passed QC</i>.</p>
<p id="terminology-project"><u><i>Project</i></u>: A research project, in which part of the work is undertaken by OICR. A <i>project</i> is considered <i>Active</i> if it has not been completed.</p>
<p id="terminology-qcable"><u><i>QCable</i></u>: An individual unit of sample processing which can be assessed for quality control. A <i>QCable</i> may be a tissue, an extracted stock, a library aliquot, or something else.</p>
<p id="terminology-qc-status">
    <u><i>QC Status</i></u>: Whether or not a <i>QCable</i> has met OICR's quality control criteria. The possible statuses are consistently colour-coded throughout Sampuru:
    <ul>
        <li>Not yet started: Grey</li>
        <li>Pending QC: Yellow</li>
        <li>Passed QC: Blue</li>
        <li>Failed QC: Red</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p id="terminology-qc-gates">
    <u><i>QC Gates</i></u>: The points in OICR's processing pipeline at which a <i>QCable</i> is assessed for quality control. The <i>QC Gates</i> are consistently represented throughout <i>Sampuru</i>:
    <ol>
        <li>Receipt/Inspection: OICR has received the sample and assessed it for usability.</li>
        <li>Extraction: OICR has prepared the sample and performed bulk DNA or RNA extraction from the sample.</li>
        <li>Library Preparation: OICR has taken the bulk DNA or RNA, performed any enrichment or targeting required, and fused the nucleic acid with Illumina library adapters required for sequencing.</li>
        <li>Low-Pass Sequencing: The libraries have been sequenced at a low depth, usually on a MiSeq, and OICR has assessed the quality of the sequenced data.</li>
        <li>Full-Depth Sequencing: The libraries have been sequenced at full depth, usually on a NovaSeq, and OICR has assessed the quality of the sequenced data.</li>
        <li>Informatics & Interpretation: Statistical analysis has been performed on the full depth sequencing data and OICR has assessed the quality of the statistical analysis.</li>
        <li>Final Report: The statistical analysis has been used to generate a report on the sample.</li>

<h2 id="cases"><i>Cases</i> Page</h2>
<p>The <i>Cases</i> page displays QC information about each <a href="#terminology-case" class="definition"><i>case</i></a> in a <a href="#terminology-project" class="definition"><i>project</i></a>. A <i>case</i> in <i>Sampuru</i> is a collection containing one tissue sample supplied to OICR and all of the extractions OICR makes from that sample. Each <i>case</i> is summarized by a <i>card</i> box containing the name of the <i>case</i>, one or more summary bars quantifying the number of <a href="#terminology-qcable" class="definition"><i>QCables</i></a> which have passed each <a href="#terminology-qc-gates" class="definition"><i>QC Gate</i></a>, and a link to pop up a view of the changelogs associated with the <i>case</i>.</p>
<p>On each <i>card</i>, there is a title bar containing a link to the <i>QCables</i> page filtered by that <i>case</i> on the left, and a chevron icon on the right. Please see <a href="#qcables"><i>QCables</i> Page</a> for more information on the <i>QCables</i> page. The <i>card</i> may be 'collapsed' to show only the title bar by clicking on the <b>chevron</b>. This can be helpful for focusing on specific <i>cases</i> by only displaying the corresponding cards. The <i>card</i> may be 'expanded' again by clicking on the <b>chevron</b> again.</p>
<p>On the body of each <i>card</i> is one or more summary bars quantifying the proportion of <i>QCables</i> which have passed each <i>QC Gate</i>. Each cell in a summary bar describes the total number of <i>QCables</i> at a <i>QC Gate</i>, the number of passed <i>QCables</i> at a <i>QC Gate</i>, and the background colour denotes the overall <a href="#terminology-qc-status" class="definition"><i>QC Status</i></a> of the <i>QC Gate</i>: blue indicates passed, yellow indicates pending, grey indicates that there are no <i>QCables</i> in that stage, and red indicates a failure. The overall <i>QC Status</i> of a <i>QC Gate</i> can also be viewed by hovering the mouse cursor over a <i>QC Gate</i>. The overall <i>QC Status</i> will appear as a tooltip.</p>
<p>The body of each <i>card</i> may have more than one summary bar on it. <i>QCables</i> that have not yet progressed to the 'Library Preparation' <i>QC Gate</i> are grouped into an unlabelled <i>QC Gate</i>. <i>QCables</i> that have progressed to the 'Library Preparation' <i>QC Gate</i> gain a 'library design'. <i>QCables</i> are grouped into summary bars per library design and the corresponding summary bar is labeled with the name of the library design.</p>
<p>On the top right of the body of each <i>card</i>, there is a 'Changelogs' link which will pop up a view of the changelogs associated with the <i>case</i>. This view contains information about the creation, changes in status, and completion of <i>QCables</i> in the <i>case</i>.</p>

<h2 id="qcables"><i>QCables</i> Page</h2>
<p>The <i>QCables</i> page displays detailed QC information on individual <a href="#terminology-qcable" class="definition"><i>QCables</i></a>. A <i>QCable</i> in <i>Sampuru</i> is any sample or extraction from a sample which can have meaningful QC information attached to it. It can be accessed through the <a href="#all-active-projects">All Active Projects</a> and <a href="#project-overview"><i>Project Overview</i></a> pages, in which case it will display QC information on all of the <i>QCables</i> in a <i>project</i>, or through the <a href="#cases"><i>Cases</i> Page</a>, in which case it will display QC information on all of the <i>QCables</i> in a <a href="#terminology-case" class="definition"><i>case</i></a>. The current view is indicated by the title in the top left corner of the page. <b><i>QCables</i> (<i>&lt;Project Name&gt;</i>)</b> indicates that the <i>QCables</i> page is showing all of the <i>QCables</i> for the indicated <i>project</i>. <b><i>QCables</i> (<i>&lt;Project Name&gt;</i>:<i>&lt;Sample ID&gt;</i>)</b> indicates that the <i>QCables</i> page is showing all of the <i>QCables</i> for the indicated <i>case</i>.</p>
<p>As a new <i>QCable</i> is created in the lab between every <a href="#terminology-qc-gates" class="definition"><i>QC Gate</i></a>, the columns of the <i>QCables</i> table on the <i>QCables</i> page represent <i>QC Gates</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>QCables</i> table on the <i>QCables</i> page is interactive. To reveal the OICR internal name for a <i>QCable</i>, and any changelogs associated with the <i>QCable</i> represented by a cell, click on the <b>cell</b>. The <a href="#terminology-qc-status" class="definition"><i>QC Status</i></a> of the <i>QCable</i> represented by a cell is denoted by its colouration: blue indicates passed, yellow indicates pending, grey indicates that there are no <i>QCables</i> in that stage, and red indicates a failure. The <i>QC Status</i> of the <i>QCable</i> can also be viewed by hovering the mouse cursor over a cell. The <i>QC Status</i> will appear as a tooltip.</p>
<p>Multiple extractions may be made from one tissue, multiple libraries may be made from one extraction, and so forth. It is for this reason that <i>case</i> names appear multiple times on the <b>Project:Case</b> column, and when clicked the cells on the table may reveal the same name on multiple rows.</p>
<p>If you know the full or partial name of a <i>QCable</i> you would like to view, there is a white <b>Search <i>QCables</i></b> bar on the top right of the page in which you can type the full or partial name. The table will dynamically filter and you do not need to press the 'enter' key. Typing into this search bar will filter the <i>QCables</i> table to rows containing at least one <i>QCable</i> matching the inputted name. To stop filtering the table, delete the name in the search bar.</p>
<p>As a <i>project</i> or <i>case</i> often contains many <i>QCables</i>, by default the table displays 10 rows at a time, and contains controls at the bottom right of the table for changing pages or jumping to a specific page. Click on the <b>chevrons</b> on the right or left of the control to jump by one page forward or backward, respectively. Click on the <b>page numbers</b> in the middle of the control to view a specific page.</p>
<p>To view more than 10 rows at a time, there is a control at the bottom left of the table for adjusting the number of rows shown per page. Click on the <b>dropdown</b>, then click on the appropriate <b>number</b> in the dropdown, to choose between displaying 10, 25, 50, or 100 rows per page. The new number of rows will appear and the control for switching between pages will update to show an adjusted number of pages. Please note that selecting a higher number of rows per page may affect the performance of this page and you may experience a slow-down in the responsiveness of the table.</p>

<h2 id="search-results">Search Results</h2>
<p>The search results page provides an overview of all the information returned by an inputted search query. The title 'Search Results: <i>&lt;Query&gt;</i>' on the top left corner of the page indicates what the inputted search query was. Three types of result information are displayed: <b><i>Project Overviews</i></b>, <b><i>Cases</i></b>, and <b><i>QCables</i></b>. Each type of result is returned in a collapsed <i>card</i> which can be expanded by clicking on the <b>chevron icon</b> on the right side of the title bar.</p>
<p>For each <a href="#terminology-project" class="definition"><i>project</i></a> name which matches the search query, a <i><b>Project Overview</b> card</i> is displayed. To view the full <i>Project Overview</i> page for the project, click the <b>title on the top left of the <i>card</i></b>. Please see <a href="#project-overview"><i>Project Overview</i></a> for more information. The expanded <i>card</i> shows detailed information about the <i>project</i>, including the name of the <i>project</i>, its creation date, a description of the <i>project</i>, the pipeline in use at OICR for the <i>project</i>, and the sequencing kits in use on the <i>project</i>. It also includes a link to the filtered <i>Cases</i> page for the <i>project</i>. Please see <a href="#cases"><i>Cases</i> Page</a> for more information.</p>
<p>If any <a href="#terminology-case" class="definition"><i>cases</i></a> were found to match the search query, a <i><b>Cases</b> card</i> is displayed. <span class="help">(Finish when the table isn't broken)</span></p>
<p>If any <a href="#terminology-qcable" class="definition"><i>QCables</i></a> were found to match the search query, a <i><b>QCables</b> card</i> is displayed. <span class="help">(Finish when the table isn't broken)</span></p>
