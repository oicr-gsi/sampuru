<h1>Sampuru User Manual</h1>
<p><i>Sampuru</i> is a system for monitoring the quality control (‘QC’) status of items in the Ontario Institute for Cancer Reserach (‘OICR’) labs. You will only be able to see information about samples you provide to OICR, and extractions made from said samples. Sampuru allows you to view information about your projects at varying degrees of granularity and allows you to map the names of your samples to OICR’s internal IDs in order to ease communication with OICR.</p>

<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p><u>Case</u>: The collection of: an individual sample received by OICR, and every QCable which is extracted from that sample.</p>
<p><u>Project</u>: A research project, in which part of the work is undertaken by OICR.</p>
<p><u>QCable</u>: An individual unit of sample processing which can be assessed for quality control. A QCable may be a tissue, an extracted stock, a library aliquot, or something else.</p>
<p>
    <u>QC Status</u>: Whether or not a QCable has met OICR’s quality control criteria. The possible statuses are consistently colour-coded throughout Sampuru:
    <ul>
        <li>Not yet started: Grey</li>
        <li>Pending QC: Yellow</li>
        <li>Passed QC: Blue</li>
        <li>Failed QC: Red</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    <u>QC Gates</u> The points in OICR’s processing pipeline at which a QCable is assessed for quality control. The QC Gates are consistently represented throughout Sampuru:
    <ol>
        <li>Receipt/Inspection: OICR has received the sample and assessed it for usability.</li>
        <li>Extraction: <span class="help">???</span></li>
        <li>Library Preparation: <span class="help">???</span></li>
        <li>Low-Pass Sequencing: The libraries have been sequenced at a low depth, usually on a MiSeq, and OICR has assessed the quality of the sequenced data.</li>
        <li>Full-Depth Sequencing: The libraries have been sequenced at full depth, usually on a NovaSeq, and OICR has assessed the quality of the sequenced data.</li>
        <li>Informatics & Interpretation: Statistical analysis has been performed on the full depth sequencing data and OICR has assessed the quality of the statistical analysis.</li>
        <li>Final Report: The statistical analysis has been used to generate a report on the sample.</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<h2>Accessing Sampuru</h2>
    <span class="help">How to get access, who to contact if you don’t have access. Your login credentials?</span>

<h2>Navigation Bar</h2>
<p>At the top of every page in Sampuru is a grey navigation bar which provides a link to the home screen, a search bar, and information about the current logged in user. The functionality of the navigation bar is the same on every page.</p>
<p>On any page, you can return to the All Active Projects list by clicking on the ‘Sampuru’ on the left side of the navigation bar.</p>
<p>On any page, you can search for projects, cases, or QCables by clicking on the white bar, typing in the full or partial name of a project or QCable, and clicking the ‘Search’ button. Please note that clicking the ‘Search’ button will navigate your browser away from the current page. Please see ‘Search Results’ for information on interpreting the resulting webpage.</p>
<p>On every page, the navigation bar will display the full name of user currently logged in on the right side.</p>


<h2>All Active Projects List</h2>
<p>The first page you will see when you log into Sampuru is the All Active Projects list. Clicking on the ‘Sampuru’ link on the navigation bar on any page will return you to this page. This page provides a high-level overview of all of the projects associated with your account. Each of your projects is summarized by a ‘card’ box containing the name of the project, links to the Cases and QCables pages for the project, and progress bars representing a high-level overview of the QC status of the cases and QCables within the project.</p>
<p>On each card, there is a title bar containing a link to the Project Overview page for that project on the left, and a chevron icon on the right. Please see ‘Project Overview’ for more information on the Project Overview page. The card may be ‘collapsed’ to show only the title bar by clicking on the chevron. This can be helpful for focusing on specific projects by only displaying the corresponding cards. The card may be ‘expanded’ again by clicking on the chevron again.</p>
<p>On the body of each card are two progress bars with titles above. The first represents cases in the project and the second represents QCables in the project.</p>
<p>Clicking the ‘Cases’ title navigates your browser to the Cases page, filtered by the project represented by the card. Please see ‘Cases page’ for more information.</p>
<p>Below the ‘Cases’ title is a progress bar which represents the completed and total cases as a proportion. The blue area of the progress bar represents the proportion visually. The text on the bar denotes completed cases out of total cases. If the text on the bar is difficult to read, the same text will also appear as a tooltip when the mouse cursor is hovered over the bar.</p>
<p>Clicking the ‘QCables’ title navigates your browser to the QCables page, filtered by the project represented by the card. Please see ‘QCables page’ for more information.</p>
<p>Below the ‘QCables’ title is a progress bar which represents the passed and total QCables as a proportion. The blue area of the progress bar represents the proportion visually.  Please note that this proportion can seem to regress if the lab creates more extractions from a sample, causing the number of total QCables to increase. The text on the bar denotes completed QCables out of total QCables. If the text on the bar is difficult to read, the same text will also appear as a tooltip when the mouse cursor is hovered over the bar.</p>

<h2>Project Overview page</h2>
<p>The Project Overview page provides detailed information about a project and the cases and QCables contained within it.</p>
<p>The title in the top left corner of the page denotes the name of the project currently being viewed.</p>
<p>The top-left box in the body of the page provides information about the project currently being viewed. This box includes the name of the project, its creation date, a description of the project, the pipeline in use at OICR for the project, and the sequencing kits in use on the project. Other information which may appear on this card includes REB information, the number of tissues received for the project, and the number of tissues OICR expects to receive for the project.</p>
<p>The top-right box provides the name and email address of the contact at OICR for the project.</p>
<p>Underneath the contact information box are the same progress bars as the All Active Projects page. Clicking the ‘Cases’ title navigates your browser to the Cases page, filtered by the project currently being viewed. Please see ‘Cases page’ for more information.</p>
<p>Below the ‘Cases’ title is a progress bar which represents the completed and total cases as a proportion. The blue area of the progress bar represents the proportion visually. The text on the bar denotes completed cases out of total cases. If the text on the bar is difficult to read, the same text will also appear as a tooltip when the mouse cursor is hovered over the bar.</p>
<p>Clicking the ‘QCables’ title navigates your browser to the QCables page, filtered by the project currently being viewed. Please see ‘QCables page’ for more information.</p> 
<p>Below the ‘QCables’ title is a progress bar which represents the passed and total QCables as a proportion. The blue area of the progress bar represents the proportion visually. Please note that this proportion can seem to regress if the lab creates more extractions from a sample, causing the number of total QCables to increase. The text on the bar denotes completed QCables out of total QCables. If the text on the bar is difficult to read, the same text will also appear as a tooltip when the mouse cursor is hovered over the bar.</p>
<p>Further down the page is a box titled ‘QCables’. This box contains a sankey diagram#Wikipedia representing the number of QCables for this project at every QC gate in the pipeline and the proportions of QCables which have progressed to the next QC gate, of QCables which are pending QC, and of QCables which have failed. Please see ‘Terminology#QC Status’ for more information. Exact numbers at each step and transition can be acquired by hovering the mouse cursor over a step or transition.</p>
<p>Below the QCables box is the Changelogs box. This box contains information about the creation, changes in status, and completion of QCables and cases.</p>
<p>Below the Changelogs box is the Files box. This box contains information about how one may retrieve Final Reports and other information about completed Cases within this project. Unlike other information in Sampuru, this information is uploaded to Sampuru manually. Please contact your project’s OICR contact (provided in the Contact Information box on this page) for clarification on the information in this box.</p>

<h2>Cases page</h2>
<p>The Cases page displays QC information about each case in a project. A ‘case’ in Sampuru is a collection containing one tissue sample supplied to OICR and all of the extractions OICR makes from that sample. Each case is summarized by a ‘card’ box containing the name of the case, one or more summary bars quantifying the number of QCables which have passed each QC gate, and a link to pop up a view of the changelogs associated with the case.</p>
<p>On each card, there is a title bar containing a link to the QCables page filtered by that case on the left, and a chevron icon on the right. Please see ‘QCables page’ for more information on the QCables page. The card may be ‘collapsed’ to show only the title bar by clicking on the chevron. This can be helpful for focusing on specific cases by only displaying the corresponding cards. The card may be ‘expanded’ again by clicking on the chevron again.</p>
<p>On the body of each card is one or more summary bars quantifying the proportion of QCables which have passed each QC gate. Each cell in a summary bar describes the total number of QCables at a QC gate, the number of passed QCables at a QC gate, and the background colour denotes the overall QC status of the QC gate: blue indicates passed, yellow indicates pending, grey indicates that there are no QCables in that stage, and red indicates a failure. The overall QC status of a QC gate can also be viewed by hovering the mouse cursor over a QC gate. The overall QC status will appear as a tooltip.</p>
<p>The body of each card may have more than one summary bar on it. QCables that have not yet progressed to the ‘Library Preparation’ QC gate are grouped into an unlabelled QC gate. QCables that have progressed to the ‘Library Preparation’ QC gate gain a ‘library design’. QCables are grouped into summary bars per library design and the corresponding summary bar is labeled with the name of the library design.</p>
<p>On the top right of the body of each card, there is a ‘Changelogs’ link which will pop up a view of the changelogs associated with the case. This view contains information about the creation, changes in status, and completion of QCables in the case.</p>

<h2>QCables page</h2>
<p>The QCables page displays detailed QC information on individual QCables. A ‘QCable’ in Sampuru is any sample or extraction from a sample which can have meaningful QC information attached to it. It can be accessed through the All Active Projects and Project Overview pages, in which case it will display QC information on all of the QCables in a project, or through the Cases page, in which case it will display QC information on all of the QCables in a case. The current view is indicated by the title in the top left corner of the page. ‘QCables (<i>&gt;Project Name&lt;</i>)’ indicates that the QCables page is showing all of the QCables for the indicated project. ‘QCables (<i>&gt;Project Name&lt;</i>:<i>&gt;Sample ID&lt;</i>)’ indicates that the QCables page is showing all of the QCables for the indicated case.</p>
<p>As a new QCable is created in the lab between every QC gate, the columns of the QCables table on the QCables page represent QC gates.</p>
<p>The QCables table on the QCables page is interactive. To reveal the OICR internal name for a QCable, and any changelogs associated with the QCable represented by a cell, click on the cell. The QC status of the QCable represented by a cell is denoted by its colouration: blue indicates passed, yellow indicates pending, grey indicates that there are no QCables in that stage, and red indicates a failure. The QC status of the QCable can also be viewed by hovering the mouse cursor over a cell. The QC status will appear as a tooltip.</p>
<p>Multiple extractions may be made from one tissue, multiple libraries may be made from one extraction, and so forth. It is for this reason that case names appear multiple times on the ‘Project:Case’ column, and when clicked the cells on the table may reveal the same name on multiple rows.</p>
<p>If you know the full or partial name of a QCable you would like to view, there is a white ‘Search QCables’ bar on the top right of the page in which you can type the full or partial name. The table will dynamically filter and you do not need to press the ‘enter’ key. Typing into this search bar will filter the QCables table to rows containing at least one QCable matching the inputted name. To stop filtering the table, delete the name in the search bar.</p>
<p>As a project or case often contains many QCables, by default the table displays 10 rows at a time, and contains controls at the bottom right of the table for changing pages or jumping to a specific page. Click the chevrons on the right or left of the control to jump by one page forward or backward, respectively. Click on the page numbers in the middle of the control to view a specific page.</p>
<p>To view more than 10 rows at a time, there is a control at the bottom left of the table for adjusting the number of rows shown per page. Click on the dropdown, then click on the appropriate number in the dropdown, to choose between displaying 10, 25, 50, or 100 rows per page. The new number of rows will appear and the control for switching between pages will update to show an adjusted number of pages. Please note that selecting a higher number of rows per page may affect the performance of this page and you may experience a slow-down in the responsiveness of the table.</p>

<h2>Search results</h2>
<p>The search results page provides an overview of all the information returned by an inputted search query. The title ‘Search Results: <Query>’ on the top left corner of the page indicates what the inputted search query was. Three types of result information are displayed: Project Overviews, Cases, and QCables. Each type of result is returned in a collapsed card which can be expanded by clicking on the chevron icon on the right side of the title bar.</p>
<p>For each project name which matches the search query, a Project Overview card is displayed. To view the full Project Overview page for the project, click the title on the top left of the card. Please see ‘Project Overview’ for more information. The expanded card shows detailed information about the project, including the name of the project, its creation date, a description of the project, the pipeline in use at OICR for the project, and the sequencing kits in use on the project. It also includes a link to the filtered Cases page for the project. Please see ‘Cases page’ for more information.</p>
<p>If any Cases were found to match the search query, a Cases card is displayed. <span class="help">(Finish when the table isn’t broken)</span></p>
<p>If any QCables were found to match the search query, a QCables card is displayed. <span class="help">(Finish when the table isn’t broken)</span></p>
